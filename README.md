My end of unit project looking at the effect of heath conditions on Covid-19 death rates

Overview:

Involved looking at a dataset containing underlying health conditions of over a million covid patients between 2020 and 2021.
The dataset was provided by the Mexican Government.

•	Created visuals looking into numbers of patients that died with each health condition
•	Created models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest and found that the optimum model to use was Logistic Regression
•	Looked into the health conditions that my model predicted make patients most at risk

Findings: Age seemed to be the greatest factor causing deaths with obesity, diabetes, renal chronic disease, immunosuppressed, and hypertension also having an effect
